# Credits
 - Some of the code here is adapted from WaifuESP from [ForgeHax](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/).
 - Thanks to iZac#2346 from [rootNET](https://rootnet.dev/) for providing the Addon API.
 - Thanks to snowslushy#6233 for editing the [frog image](https://i.imgur.com/UI94ded.png).
 - I don't know who took the original image, or who edited the mouth, or who added the sunglasses, so I can't give
 proper credit for that.
 - Praise be to the frog.
